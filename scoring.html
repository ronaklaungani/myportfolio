		<h3>Understanding the Concept</h3>

		<p class="sub-title">Soccer Scoring App (SSA) was ideated as a plugin to an already live SaaS product: The Tournament Management Tool.</p>

		<p class="body-text"><i class="las la-play"></i> <span class="highlight">Tournament Management Tool (let's call it TMT)</span> enables sports academies and authorities to organise and manage tournaments in a much efficient way compared to the previous paper based system.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> A tournament organizer creates a soccer match using TMT by adding players for two teams, a venue, time slot and attaching a referee's profile to it.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> When we put TMT through usability testing with a bunch of stakeholders, the feedback suggested that we could go a step further with the experience by building an interface that allows the referees to save match data(like scores and events) during the match, in real time.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> This data, scores & events can then be viewed by fans on the tournament website as “LIVE SCORES”.<br>
		</p>

		<p class="sub-title">Presets</p>

		<p class="body-text">Since a referee is already a part of the TMT system, and the <span class="highlight">Soccer Scoring App (let's call it SSA)</span> is an "extension" to it - the <span class="highlight">referees don't need to sign-up</span> for SSA & rather will use their existing TMT account credentials to log-in.</p>



		<h3>Research & Elicitation</h3>

		<p class="sub-title">Methods</p>

		<p class="body-text">Research Methods:<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Interviews with team stakeholders<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Interviews with owners of soccer academies<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Understanding the existing paper-based scoring documents.</p>

		<p class="sub-title">Conclusions</p>

		<p class="body-text"><span class="highlight"><i class="las la-play"></i> There can be multiple referees for a tournament<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> The app will be used outdoors, can be under sun or rain with dust<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> A player's jersey number is an important metric to register an event with a player<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> The match halves do not have a fixed time frame - every match can be of different time limit<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> To be also used by uneducated coaches on mobile phones with older versions of Android<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> We were able to access the paper based scoring sheets to analyse the type of data usually added in a football match.</span></p>





		<h3>Key Hypothesis</h3>


		<div class="three-segment">		
			<div class="segment-box"><p class="sub-title">User <i class="las la-user"></i></p>
				<p class="body-text">Age: Around 30 to 60+, majorly male, occupation: professional coaches, retired players, academy staff and caretakers; education: high-schoolers to grads, low-to-moderate tech savviness.</p>

				<p class="sub-title">Tasks <i class="las la-tasks"></i></p>
				<p class="body-text">Tap event > select associated player.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="segment-box"><p class="sub-title">Goal <i class="las la-check-circle"></p>
				<p class="body-text">To add an event happening in the match within a short time frame.</p>

				<p class="sub-title">Environment <i class="las la-tree"></i></p>
				<p class="body-text">Outdoors; can be sunny, rainy, dusty and humid. <span class="highlight">Hence, the app should have higher contrast ratios with big distinct iconography and colors.</span></p>

			</div>
			<div class="segment-box">
				<p class="sub-title">Tools <i class="las la-desktop"></i></p>
				<p class="body-text">The product will be a <span class="highlight">native mobile app, also including older android versions;</span> can be extended to tablets in later versions of the product.</p>

				<p class="sub-title">More...</p>
				<p class="body-text"><i class="las la-play"></i> The referee would want to <span class="highlight">access the past matches</span><br>
				<i class="las la-play"></i> The interface should be <span class="highlight">expandable to other sports</span> as well<br>
				<i class="las la-play"></i> The product will also include a match creator in the future so it can be used by users other than TMT users.</p>

			<p class="body-text caption"><i class="las la-play"></i> Initial Ideas for the interface design</p>


			<p class="sub-title">1 - <span class="body-text">Referees already have their log-in details as they are already members of the TMT.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">2 - <span class="body-text">A segmented screen to allow refrees <span class="highlight">to view past matches</span> as well.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">3 - <span class="body-text">Most important details like the <span class="highlight">time, venue, teams, etc. of the matches</span> are mentioned here to help the referee select the right match.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">4 - <span class="body-text"> The filter on the top right corner can <span class="highlight">filter the list based on academy</span> (if the referee is part of multiple tournaments/academies) and sport.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">5 - <span class="body-text">The match screen <span class="highlight">lists the details again to aviod any confusion</span> or error.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">6 - <span class="body-text">For a soccer match, there are always <span class="highlight">2 halves, which can be accessed from this section</span> of the screen seperately.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">7 - <span class="body-text">The referee can also <span class="highlight">record the toss winner & the decision</span> taken by the winning captain.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">8 - <span class="body-text">An <span class="highlight">option to reset</span> the match data.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">9 - <span class="body-text">The play button is to <span class="highlight">control the timer</span> on the screen.</span></p><br>

			<div class="sub-title">How to enter an event log?</div>

			<p class="sub-title">10 - <span class="body-text">There are <span class="highlight">eight important match events for soccer</span>,(obtained from an interview with academy owners). Each event is listed as a big tile with a <span class="highlight">differentiating icon so that it can be located easily on a screen.</span> On tapping any event, the player selection screen (point 12) will appear for the referee to select which player was associated with the event.</span></p><br>

			<p class="sub-title">11 - <span class="body-text">At the bottom of the screen is a <span class="highlight">button to access the "event log"</span> (point 13). When a referee adds an event, it <span class="highlight">gets added to the event log</span> with the most recent event visible on the button on this screen. The referee <span class="highlight">can undo</span> the event if needed.</span></p><br>

			<p class="sub-title">12 - <span class="body-text">The player selection screen is a required action after selecting an event in order <span class="highlight">to determine the player associated with the event.</span> It's clear from the research that a referee identifies a player by his/her jersey number. Hence, the <span class="highlight">jersey number gets an emphasis</span> here so that the <span class="highlight">referee can easily locate the right player.</span></span></p><br>

			<p class="sub-title">13 - <span class="body-text">The referee can access the Event Log any time during or after the match; and <span class="highlight">can delect a log</span> if needed.</span></p><br><br>



			<div class="sub-title">An example of an event log: Jersey no.15 <span class="highlight">(player)</span>, Ronak Laungani Scored a goal <span class="highlight">(event)</span> at 13:24 <span class="highlight">(time)</span>.</div>



		<h3>Knitting the Aesthetics</h3>
		<p class="body-text">Based on all my research and elicitaions, we came a conclusion about using colors with high contrast, distinct iconography and crisp design elements. The font has also been selected keeping in mind the sense of visibility.</p>

		<h3>The Final Product</h3>
