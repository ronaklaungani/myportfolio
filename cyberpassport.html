		<h3>The Problem at Hand</h3>

		<p class="body-text">The National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) has laid down a one-for-all curriculum (or syllabus) to standardize the education for cybersecurity in the United States. This is called the NICE framework. Accredited educational and professional institutions from around the United States adapt this curriculum to organize workshops to train students and cybersecurity enthusiasts. So we need to solve the following problems:<br><br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Breakdown the NICE framework and design a curriculum page where users can easily explore and understand it<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Create a platform which allows the organizers to organize workshops and link them to the curriculum<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Allow users to explore these workshops and the curriculum associated with it<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Allow users to book these workshops through an online portal<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Allow users to build their profile so they can add the skills attained through the workshops<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Build tools to help the organizers in organizing the workshops, even for the on-ground operations.<br>
		</p>

		<h3>Understanding the Data</h3>

		<p class="sub-title">Breaking down the curriculum</p>

		<p class="body-text">The NICE framework drawn by the NIST is a very large and complicated system of nodes. It is very important for the user to understand the taxonomies of the curriculum before making a decision about their career choices. Hence, it is really important to give users a very easy portal to explore anything and everything about the framework. But before that, let's breakdown the data. Here's how this data was shared with us:
		</p>

	</div>

	<img src="assets/cp/cp4.png" class="big-bg-imgs-2">

	<div class="text-body-box">
		<p class="body-text">
		Now. Yes, I know this is a lot to organize. But that's what makes the problem so interesting to solve. There are 3000+ rows of data per sheet provided by the NIST for the framework. The framework has four main entities, each falling under the previous one in heirarchy:<br>

		<span class="highlight">Speciality Areas <i class="las la-play"></i> Job Roles <i class="las la-play"></i> Competencies <i class="las la-play"></i> Knowledge/Skills/Abilities/Tasks (KSATs)</span><br>
		<br>
		Here's how these entities are related to each other:
		</p>
	</div>

	<img src="assets/cp/cp5.png" class="big-bg-imgs-2">


	<div class="text-body-box">
		<p class="body-text">
		And yes, those are the colors and shapes we are going to use to show the entities throughout the design system. Now that we understand how the framework has been designed, let's see how we decided upon "the most relevant entity".
		</p>

		<p class="sub-title">How does a user attain a Work Role?</p>

		<p class="body-text">
		Now the curriculum is known, the users are on the website; how do they learn and, most importantly get the certificate / badge / credit for learning these things? <span class="highlight">Workshops.</span><br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Professional and educational institutions can organize workshops, and link the curriculum to it.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> The users attend this workshop, and the linked curriculum gets added to their profile.
		</p>

		<img src="assets/cp/cp9.png" class="text-body-img-trans">


		<p class="sub-title">How can one link the curriculum to a workshop?</p>

		<p class="body-text">
		Before we go ahead, it's really important to figure out the most relevant entity. The one users will understand the quickest and find easier to navigate with. Will the user search for workshops based on the Work Roles it covers? Or is that too broad?<br>
		After weeks of discussion with the team and weighing all the metrics, we decided that <span class="highlight">"Competency is the most relevant entity".</span> And for the following reasons:<br>
		<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Most importantly - during a workshop, a Work Role is taught by covering the competencies; but not all competencies are covered during each workshop. Hence a user might cover "some" competencies of a Work Role<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Competencies serve as granular "chapters" for each Work Role, but are not too granular like KSATs<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> This means the user can have a granular understanding of the Work Role and will approach the Work Role like students approach a course - a series of chapters<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> It is less complicated to use it as a filtering or sorting factor on the home page. Meaning: the user can filter the workshops based on Competencies and find the one that fits their interest.<br>
		<br>
		Hence, while creating a workshop, the organizing institute can <span class="highlight">link the competencies to the workshop.</span> And when the users attend this workshop, these linked competencies get added to their profile - where they can keep track of their progress and share their profile with potential recruiters.
		</p>

	</div>

	<img src="assets/cp/cp7.png" class="big-bg-imgs-2">


	<div class="text-body-box">


		<p class="sub-title">How can users build their profile?</p>

		<p class="body-text">
		Our users will be working hard, attending hours of workshops to attain competencies that will eventually add up to a work role. To make this process more rewarding, I focused hard to <span class="highlight">gamify</span> the whole product experience. As a part of this effort, I introduced what we named as the <span class="highlight">Career Path.</span><br>
		It is a section where the users can plan, follow and keep a track of their cybersecurity career. The section has three main parts:<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i><span class="highlight"> My Work Roles:</span> A list of all Work Roles, with a tracker for each showing the total number of competencies required and the number of competencies completed by the user.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i><span class="highlight"> My Focus List:</span> This feature is expected to help our users in a major way (Usability studies are going on as I write this). We've provided a section where users can add competencies they need to focus on. Our smart algorithm then suggests workshops and organizations based on the user's focus list. The user is also notified when a new workshop related to their focus list is posted.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i><span class="highlight"> My Following List:</span> Users can follow organizations to get notified whenever a new workshop is posted by that organization.<br>
		<br>
		These three features help the user to have a focused approach towards what they want to achieve.

		<p class="sub-title">Building tools for the organizers.</p>

		<p class="body-text">
		Our team at Cyberpassport strongly believed and shared the enthusiasm of teaching with the organizations. Hence, we wanted to build the right tools for them so their work could be done in a much easier and proficient way. Here are few of the features we designed specifically for our organizers:<br>
		<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i><span class="highlight"> Simplified forms</span> to create workshops and easily link competencies.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i><span class="highlight"> Team builder</span> to allow the organization admin to build and manage a team that can assist in organizing as well as conducting workshops.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i><span class="highlight"> QR code scanner</span> built right in their Cyberpassport mobile app so they can check-in and check-out the workshop attendees at the venue without the need of a desktop.<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i><span class="highlight"> Manage Registration</span> from anywhere. Add new registrations on the go with the the Cyberpassport mobile app.

		<h3>Presets</h3>

		<p class="body-text">
		When I joined the team, there was already a website in existence, like a proof of concept:</p>

		My job on arrival was to improve the User Experience of the product in terms of end-to-end experience, information architecture, navigation and UI Design. As we already know by now, it is a data heavy product and hence it becomes very important that the users understand this data. That, was my role - improve the understanding of the product along with giving it a visual identity. I was also given the liberty to rethink features and suggest new ones if needed.<br>

		Now that we are clear about the features (from the Research section) that need to be a part of our system, let's define our functional requirements:<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Organizers can create a workshop on the desktop web app & link competencies to it<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Users approved by the organizers can also create workshops<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Users can browse through the list of workshops based on competencies, location and time of the workshop<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Users can register for the workshops online<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> Each user should have a unique QR code - to be scanned at the workshop venue<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> The system should update the user's profile with obtained competencies after every workshop<br>
		<i class="las la-play"></i> User should be able to plan their workshops under "My Career Path".
		<br>
		<br>
		Keeping of all the functionalities in mind, I divided the product into four main sections to draw up the navigation.

		<p class="sub-title">Quick Mock-up</p>

		<p class="body-text">My design approach involves getting a lot of insights from the users and stakeholders early on. I like to quickly mock-up my ideas and give a prototype in the hands of the users to gain valuable feedback in the form of usability testing results. I also keep iterating my designs during this process.</p>

		<p class="sub-title">Initial Mock-up</p>

		<p class="body-text">After conducting heuristic analysis of the existing product, and weighing all the functional requirements, I designed this <a href="https://www.sketch.com/s/q7xw3/v/1K59Dw/a/2d03MQ/play" target="_blank" class="highlight">Initial Mock-up <i class="las la-external-link-square-alt"></i></a></p>

		<p class="sub-title">Initial Stakeholder Feedback</p>

		<p class="body-text"><i class="las la-play"></i> The overall design is good, the colors are interactive and the layout looks professional<br>
 		<i class="las la-play"></i> The product looks more event driven, like eventbrite<br>
 		<i class="las la-play"></i> It needs to be more user focused where users can explore, plan and build their cybersecurity profile. It should be more about user progress.<br></p>

			<p class="sub-title">1 - <span class="body-text">The opening screen of the app allows the user to proceed without a log-in. This allows the user to explore the app before committing to being a user. On this screen, the user can explore work roles and choose competencies to filter their home screen results. This helps the software to suggest relevant workshops based on user choices.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">2 - <span class="body-text">The updated design has a dashboard at the top on the home page. This is an attempt to make the app more about the user and their progress. User can check their progress for two of their ongoing work roles.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">3 - <span class="body-text">This also allows us the space to add an easy access button to the unique QR code.</span></p>

			<p class="sub-title">4 - <span class="body-text">On the Home page, we display the most relevant workshops for the user, filtered by selected location and competencies.</span></p>

		<h3>Crafting the Visual Language</h3>

		<p class="sub-title">Typography</p>

		<p class="body-text">Keep it simple, silly. I've used a simple yet a very versatile font family for the complete project: Lato. The variety of weight options, the partially curved edges make it just the right font to go with the design concepts in my mind.</p>

		<img src="assets/cp/cp12.png" class="big-bg-imgs-2">

		<p class="sub-title">Colors</p>

		<p class="body-text">The initial usability test suggested that we could drop the bright orange and use a bit more cooler color sheme. Blue suits well since it is the color for trust and has a sincere feel to it. A perfect color for an educational app. Yellow as the secondary color complements the blue and is mainly used to signify competencies throughout the system.</p>

		<img src="assets/cp/cp13.png" class="big-bg-imgs-2">

		<p class="sub-title">Iconography</p>

		<p class="body-text">Iconography for this product has been designed inspired by the simplest of ideas we encounter around us. Taking advantage of the basic human intuition, we have worked hard to make this app easy to understand and navigate. Icons, with no doubt have played the major part in this process. </p>

		<img src="assets/cp/cp15.png" class="big-bg-imgs-2">

		<p class="sub-title">Designing the Entities</p>

		<p class="body-text">Since the project involved a complex taxonomy for the data, I wanted to create disctinct visual representation for each entitity of the product. This made sure the entities and the relation between them is communicated well through the project.</p>

		<p class="sub-title">Language</p>

		<p class="body-text">Language is how we communicate, how we share, how we express our intentions. It is highly important that we use this important asset in the best way possible. Language, is as important as an icon for visual design. To make sure we set the right tone for our product that matches the color scheme, we strictly followed these three foundation elements: Friendly, Precise and Informative.<br>
